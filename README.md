# Form

A small project set by Finer Vision. Had less than a day to do it due to still having exams, but it's fully functional. 

## Task
Create	a	simple	data	entry	form	that	stores	the	required	data	into	a	database	table.	This	form	
must	work	well	in	the	latest	versions	of	the	Google	Chrome	browser.	You	are	not	required	to	
browser	test	the	front	end	in	any	other	browser,	although	bonus	points	will	be	rewarded	if	
you	do
